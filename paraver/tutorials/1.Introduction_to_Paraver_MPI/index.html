The above analysis went directly to the detailed timeline, but a less
detailed averaged statistic can often be sufficient to identify
problems and gives a summarized view of the behavior of an
application. Paraver provides one mechanism to obtain such profiles
for the desired region of a trace. We call it the <I>2D Analyzer</I>
as it is a very flexible mechanism to generate tables of summarized
statistics.  Let's use it:</P>

The same mechanism used to compute profiles can be used to compute

	microseconds (<I>Delta</I> value in the <I>Control</I>
	section of the Main Window). The pixels at the left of the table
	represent short durations, those at the right represent 
	large duration. Every pixel is colored with the percentage of time

	corresponding to the pixel column. The color encoding is light green
	for a low percentage, dark blue for a high percentage (low and high
	are defined by the Minimum and Maximum values in the “Control”

	 Ideally on a balanced SPMD application you would expect vertical

	 It is possible to change the statistic so that the actual value

	value of other metric (such as “IPC”). For example, in the
	<I>Statistics</I> section of the Main Window, you can change
	the statistic selector to <I>Average value</I> and select
	<I>Instructions Per Cycle</I> as the data window. You can
	change the range of the coloring scheme in the <I>Statistics: Minimum Gradient
	</I>and <I>Statistics: Maximum  Gradient</I> fields in the Main Window. 
        For example, if you put a 0.7
	in the <I>Statistics: Minimum Gradient</I> field in the Main Window,
	you will be able to clearly differentiate regions with less than
	that IPC (light orange), regions just above 0.7 IPC (light green)
	and regions close to the Max IPC (dark blue, 0.9 in this case). This
	mechanism is very useful to analyze correlations between metrics.
