    <h1>Introduction to the Use of Dimemas</h1>
    <h2>Tutorial material</h2>
    <p>This tutorial contains an example and guidelines to get started on the
      use of Dimemas. In the directory where it is located you can find:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p> A Paraver trace <font face="monospace">Iberia-128-CA.chop1.1it.shifted.prv</font>
          for a 128 processor run of the WRF application. The traces was
          obtained on MareNostrum with Extrae, using the <font face="monospace">LD_PRELOAD</font>
          mechanism to intercept entries and exits to MPI. The trace contains
          events on entry and exit to the MPI calls and hardware counter (cache
          misses, instructions and cycles) events at these points.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Its corresponding <i>.pcf</i> file with the symbolic information for
          the numerically encoded records in the trace.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A directory <font face="monospace">./cfgs</font> with some paraver
          configuration files that will be used during the analysis of the
          traces obtained in this session.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Four initial Dimemas configuration files named <font face="monospace">MN.128.{1,2,4,8}ppn.cfg</font></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A directory <font face="monospace">./full_session.1ppn</font> with
          all the derived Dimemas configuration files and its simulation outputs
          for the 1-processor-per-node configuration. We recommended to
          initially ignore its content and follow the tutorial to get acquainted
          with Dimemas and DimemasGUI.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>We provide a Paraver trace file describing an actual run (one iteration)
      of the WRF code in MareNostrum2 supercomputer. Our objective is to perform
      several Dimemas simulations to identify the sensitivity of the application
      performance to interconnect parameters.</p>
    <p>A first step would be to model with Dimemas the actual MareNostrum2
      configuration and check whether the prediction matches the actual
      behavior. Then we can proceed to study the potential benefit of
      hypothetical changes in the architecture.</p>
    <h2>Generating a Dimemas trace and performing a simulation</h2>
    <p>The first step is to convert the Paraver trace into a Dimemas file using
      <font face="monospace">prv2dim</font>. To do so, execute the following
      command in a terminal window:</p>
    <table width="80%">
      <colgroup><col> </colgroup>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10" valign="MIDDLE" bgcolor="Lavender">
            <font face="monospace">&gt; $(DIMEMAS_HOME)/bin/prv2dim
              Iberia-128-CA.chop1.1it.shifted.prv
              Iberia-128-CA.chop1.1it.shifted.dim</font> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>The Dimemas configuration file&nbsp;<font face="monospace">
        MN.128.1ppn.cfg&nbsp;</font> included in the tutorial directory
      describes an architecture model idealized from MareNostrum2
      interconnection network (8 us latency, 250 MB/s but no contention in the
      network) with only one process per node. Run the following the command in
      a terminal window:</p>
    <table width="80%">
      <colgroup><col> </colgroup>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10" valign="MIDDLE" bgcolor="Lavender">
            <font face="monospace">&gt; $(DIMEMAS_HOME)/bin/Dimemas -S 32K -p
              prediction.1ppn.prv MN.128.1ppn.cfg</font> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In a few seconds you should get the <span style="font-family: monospace;">prediction.1ppn.prv</span>
      Paraver trace trace which is a reconstruction of what would have been the
      behavior on the machine modeled by the <font face="monospace">MN.128.1ppn.cfg</font>
      file.</p>
    <p>We can now load the <a href="Iberia-128-CA.chop1.1it.shifted.prv">original
        trace</a> (<font face="monospace">Iberia-128-CA.chop1.1it.shifted.prv</font>)<font
        face="monospace"> </font>in Paraver and the <font face="monospace"><a
          href="cfgs/mpi_call.cfg">cfgs/mpi_call.cfg</a></font>. We can do the
      same thing with the <a href="prediction.1ppn.prv">predicted trace</a> (<span
        style="font-family: monospace;">prediction.1ppn.prv</span>). Also load <font
        face="monospace"><a href="cfgs/mpi_call.cfg">cfgs/mpi_call.cfg</a></font>)
      with this second trace. In order to ensure that both windows are at the
      same timescale, we should copy it from the original to the synthetic trace
      (right click in the original trace timeline window, select <i>"Copy",</i>
      and then move to the timeline of the synthetic trace and do <i>"Paste
        Size"</i> and <i>"Paste Time"</i>). We can see that the prediction of
      Dimemas is slightly optimistic, but quite close to the reality.</p>
    <h2>Changing the machine model</h2>
    <p>Let us assume that we are interested in finding out what would be the
      impact of a slower network (i.e. only 10 MB/s). We should use the Dimemas
      GUI to tune the <i>cfg</i> file. First load the GUI executing following
      command in your terminal:</p>
    <table width="80%">
      <colgroup><col> </colgroup>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10" valign="MIDDLE" bgcolor="Lavender">
            <font face="monospace">&gt; $(DIMEMAS_HOME)/bin/DimemasGUI</font> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Once the it has load, follow the next sequence of action:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p> <i>"Configuration"</i> → <i>"Load configuration"</i> and select
          the file <font face="monospace">MN.128.1ppn.cfg</font></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>"Configuration"</i> → <i>"Target configuration"</i>. Click on the
          <i>"Config"</i> button by the "<i>Environment information"</i> to
          change the <em>"Network Bandwidth"</em> to 10.0 MB/s (please
          introduce the trailing dot and zero characters). Then click <i>"Save".</i></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><i>"Configuration"</i> → <i>"Save configuration"</i> to a file (e.g.
          <font face="monospace">MN.128.1ppn.10MBps.cfg</font>)</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Perform the Dimemas simulation specifying a name for the output Paraver
      file and the just saved Dimemas configuration file:</p>
    <table width="80%">
      <colgroup><col> </colgroup>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 10" valign="MIDDLE" bgcolor="Lavender">
            <font face="monospace">&gt; $(DIMEMAS_HOME)/bin/Dimemas -S 32K -p
              prediction.1ppn.10MBs.prv MN.128.1ppn.10MBps.cfg</font> </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>Now, load this simulated Paraver trace, load the <font face="monospace"><a href="cfgs/mpi_call.cfg">cfgs/mpi_call.cfg</a></font>
      on it and copy its timescale to the other two traces we had already
      loaded. We can see that although the reduction in bandwidth was very
      significant (divided by 25), the actual impact on performance was not huge
      (just 15%)</p>
    <p>We may thus wonder what would be the impact of reducing bandwidth
      further. Let us say to just 5 MB/s. You can repeat this process generating
      a new configuration file with this modification in the interconnection
      network bandwidth. Now the impact starts to be larger. It is also apparent
      that the impact is not the same in all phases of the time-line. you can
      load the <font face="monospace"><a href="cfgs/p2p_size.cfg">cfgs/p2p_size.cfg</a></font>
      configuration and it will be apparent that the communication phases that
      are more sensitive to the bandwidth are those with larger messages as one
      would expect. In general, the actual impact of a reduction in bandwidth
      will depend on the computational granularity of the application, the
      message sizes, but also on the level of load balance and the actual use of
      asynchronous communications within the application or its tolerance to
      shifts in process pipelining.</p>
    <h3>- What is the impact of the latency?</h3>
    <p> You may start from the original <font face="monospace">MN.128.1ppn.cfg</font>
      description. Come back to the Dimemas GUI, load the configuration file
      asdo the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><i>“Configuration" </i><i>→ "Target configuration”</i>. Push the <i>"Config"</i>
          button by the <i>"Node information</i>" label.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Change the <i>"Startup"</i> value under the "<em>Inter-node
            communication parameters</em>" section and set it for example to
          0.0001, to model a 100 us latency.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> After changing it click on the <i>"Do all the same"</i> button to
          apply the new latency to all nodes (you could actually specify
          different latencies for different nodes, the node number's showed up
          at the top of this window).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> <i>"Save"</i> the specified latencies (startups). In Dimemas terms,
          latency is not end to end but actually represents the local overhead
          an MPI implementation has. It is assumed to use the CPU and after it,
          data transfer can start.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p> Create a new Dimemas configuration file (again <span style="font-style: italic;">"Configuration"</span>
          → <span style="font-style: italic;">"Save configuration"</span>) and
          perform the simulation (executing the simulator in the terminal
          window).</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you load the resulting trace in Paraver, you can see that the
      performance impact of such bad latency is negligible for this trace.</p>
    <h3>- Would I benefit from multi-rail adapters?</h3>
    <p> Start from the configuration of 5 MB/s. Go back to the Dimemas GUI. In
      the <i>"Node information"</i> window change the <i>"Input links"</i> and
      "<em>Output links</em>" under the "<em>Inter-node communications
        parameters</em>" section to 2. Save the configuration file and simulate.</p>
    <p> You can see a certain potential gain by this configuration. One might
      also study increasing the input links but not the output links. Although
      not a foreseeable feature of future architectures, this structure can give
      insight on the structure of the application. For example if one region of
      an application shows an improvement in this situation, it means that there
      is significant end point contention. One would probably suggest to the
      application developer to restructure the schedule of communications so
      that not all processes send to the same processes at the same time, a
      frequently disregarded problem in many codes.</p>
    <h3>- What is the impact of contention?</h3>
    <p> Starting again from the original machine description you can wonder
      whether contention caused by bad routing can hurt the performance. One way
      of modeling this at a very abstract level is to change the <i>"Number of
        buses"</i> parameter in the "<i>Environment information"</i> window. The
      number you put in this field is the maximum number of possible concurrent
      transfers (except that a 0 means no limit on the number of concurrent
      communications). A value of 1 would mean the network topology would be a
      bus, with only one possible transfer at any time. You can vary this
      parameter and see how sensitive is the application to contention. In our
      case, the application still performs well with a very small number of
      concurrent transfers (i.e. 2 is actually enough).</p>
    <h3>- What would be the impact of a faster processor?</h3>
    <p> For the previous machine description change the "<i>Relative processor
        speed"</i> of the "<i>Node information"</i> window to 5.0. This will
      model a processor 5 times faster in the execution of the sequential
      computation burst between MPI calls. You will observe that now the
      application is more sensitive to contention. You will need to increase the
      number of buses to achieve a good efficiency.</p>
    <p> An interesting simulation is to assume infinite bandwidth (you have to
      put a 0 in the "<i>Network bandwidth"</i> field on the <em>"Environment
        information"</em> window) and zero latency (<i>"Startup"</i> value under
      the "<em>Inter-node communication parameters</em>" on the <span style="font-style: italic;">"Node
        information"</span> window). This will give a limit of the efficiency of
      the application due to load imbalance and dependence chains.</p>
    <h3>- What happens if we simulate 2 processors per node? What about 4 and 8?</h3>
    <p> At this point, try to repeat the whole analysis described in this
      section varying <i>"Number of processors"</i> per node, and the processes (or
      "tasks") assigned to each node. To do so, run the simulator using the Dimemas 
      configuration files  <font face="monospace">MN.128.2ppn.cfg</font> (2 processes
      per node), <font face="monospace">MN.128.4ppn.cfg</font> (4 processes
      per node), and <font face="monospace">MN.128.8ppn.cfg</font> (8 processes
      per node). Compare the results with the simulations with less processors.</p>
    <h2>Visualization of the internals of the communication</h2>
    <p> Given that Dimemas has knowledge of the actual point in time where a
      data transfer takes place, it can emit such information to the generated
      Paraver file. The following Paraver configuration files shows how this
      information can be visualized or which measurements can be made. Let us
      assume we do a simulation with 10x processor speed, only 20 concurrent
      communication.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configuration file <font face="monospace"><a href="cfgs/used_network_bw.cfg">/cfgs/used_network_bw.cfg</a></font>
        &gt;displays the aggregated instantaneous bandwidth through the network.
